        text:'Many people would say that I am still old school but then, I love my good old, plain, VSCode editor. This has been my favorite since i left the Notepad family. I know many other great, AI powered editors are making waves out there right now, but I prefer working with VSCode. It recently provides Copilot AI for free as well, so its a win win. Majorly, I love this editor because of its many extensions which makes my life easy.'

With CSS I can structure the website layout with ease which helps fit the web application perfectly on whatever device is used to load it. My aim when designing with this technology is to produce pixel perfect designs from a design file."

This technology makes static web pages and applications come to life. I use this technology to add programmatic capabilities to my web application like fetching data, conditionally renderiing sections of a website or allowing my web applications to communicate with servers via APIs."

ReactJs allows for reusability of several components and the latest version (v.19) allows components to optionally be rendered on the server. This increases page load speed leading to overall increase in app performance metrics.'

This includes file routing, server side rendering by default, optimized components like Images, fonts, and layouts, etc. NextJs Allows me to write fullstack application owing to its server first approach. This means that I can write applications that communicate with database directly from the same codebase.'

        text:'Git is a version control system. It is a tool that allows me to track changes. building applications require a way for you to track versions of your application as you build. Git makes this seamless and easy. Git is like facebook for programmers: You write your codes upload them on Git, get stars, fork repos, earn badges or even sponsorship and much more. I have been using github from my time as an intern at ALX Africa and since then its become a part of my grow. Git provides you with very helpful process like collabortion, contribution, and codebase snapshot. Codebase snapshot helps you track your code upload up to a certain point (where things probably broke) and you can take your codebase back to that version and start afresh.'

        title: 'TypeScript',
        text:'TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It is a statically typed language. Javascript on its own is a loosely typed language. What that means is that javascript does not make provision for typesafety as anything goes with it. There are many tools out there which developers can use to constrain user into providing the appropriate type of data everytime, but my favorite is TYPESCRIPT. Typescript comes with many benefit including very good typesafety features, auto complete while working with objects, and, as a VSCode bonus, I have detailed intellisense which makes my life very easy'
